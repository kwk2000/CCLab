    <p id="p1">My initial inspiration is from a youtube video about raindrops sliding on the window. It’s very relaxing, especially with the sound of raindrops falling on the window. And my project attempts to reappear such scene as much as possible. 
      Users are recommended to turn p5 to dark mode before running the project.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p id="p2">At the very beginning of my project, you would see a scene which is, from top to bottom,  colored from bright to dark gray and surrounded by a trapezoidal frame, which is trying to give a feeling that you are looking at the outside through a window. Then suddenly, it began raining, as some drops with color of light blue begin falling down. After that, you see some drops assemble on the top of your window, and gradually become bigger, and then begin falling down.</p>
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="content">
    <p id="p3">The rain seems to be very heavy, since the drops keep on rolling down on your window and it became harder to see what’s happening outside. So you decided to use your hand(?)to mope the window and see if it’s still raining heavily outside--and the answer seems to be quite obvious, since the area you’ve just cleaned out is quickly again covered by new raindrops. Then, for the rest of the afternoon, you keep on moping on the window, while the raindrop keep on rolling down on your window and let your effort go to waste.</p>
